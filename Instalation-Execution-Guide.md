## Requirements

| Component        |    Minimum version     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------  |

| NPM              |     3.10.10 or greater |


## Installation Guide - PRD

Assure that config/config.json.PRD is correctly filled. 

Create a dockerfile with node and npm and follow the steps below.

1. Rename the file "config/config.json.PRD" to "config/config.json"

2. Create the volume "control", "data" e "log" to be linked to an external volume (outside container).

3. Execute npm install

4. Configure the running of the docker image to fire "npm start".

----

Execute the following steps to prepare the env (if not prepared):

1. Create the directories and assign permissions 
* mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/trubudget/
* mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/trubudget/control 
* mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/trubudget/log 
* mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/trubudget/data 


2. Create a file .env defining 

    TRUW001A_SAP_USER – SAP service user <br>
    TRUW001A_SAP_PASS – Password of SAP service user <br>
    TRUW001A_TRU_USER - Trubudget service user <br>
    TRUW001A_TRU_PASS – Password of Trubudget service user

3. Assign the necessary permissions.

------

Execute the following steps using docker-compose.yml:

1. Reference all the env variables (see definition before)

2. Link the volumes to folders located outside the container. 
The volume "control" needs to be linked to a folder with daily backup. The volumes "data" and "log" do not need daily backup.

3. If you are running in DSV, you need to execute a command to replace config.json with config.json.DEV. Similar comments to other envs. 

4. Execute npm start



## Execution Guide

In DSV:
* cd /opt/docker/composers/trubudget
* Check if it is necessary to change docker-compose.yml. Analyze mainly the image name.
* docker pull image-name
* docker-compose up

In PRD:

The docker needs to be called by TWS daily. It should run at the begining of the night production. The easiest way is to create a Rundeck script to be the mediator. So, TWS will call Rundeck and Rundeck will call the container. The container will fire npm start, as described in the installation guide.

If it is not the first time the integration script is installed (in other words, it is an update of the integration script), it may be necessary to recover the files control/arqTBUploadDate.json, control/pilotProjectsFilter.txt and log/executionOutput.log of the previous executions.
